Course Project for Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data

The run_analysis.R script does the following.  It is well commented:

downloads a data set from Samsung phone data, 
combines test and train data,
creates a tidy data set that includes the average of the mean and standard deviation of various features for each activity (6 physical actions such as walking downstairs and standing) and each subject (30 individuals).
